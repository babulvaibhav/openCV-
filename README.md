# openCV-
This repo. contains both the thoretical and practical portions of openCV library.


OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library.
OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products. 
Being a BSD-licensed product, OpenCV makes it easy for businesses to utilize and modify the code.

As a part of learning computer vision & Image processing I started learning openCV with python.
