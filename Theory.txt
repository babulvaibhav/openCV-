In digital imaging, a pixel(or picture element) is the smallest item of information in an image.
 Pixels are arranged in a 2-dimensional grid, represented using squares. Each pixel is a sample of an original image,
 where more samples typically provide more-accurate representations of the original. 
The intensity of each pixel is variable; in color systems, each pixel has typically three or four
 components such as red, green, and blue, or cyan, magenta, yellow, and black.
The word pixel is based on a contraction of pix ("pictures") and el (for "element").

 Q. What is DPI / PPI?
  :- DPI refers to dots per inch when using an ink based printer. It is a measure of resolution or image quality.
    Typically, the higher the dpi count, the better the print quality. This term is still used when discussing digital image quality; 
   however, this is not the correct term.\par
     PPI describes the resolution, in pixels, of an image to be printed within a specified space. For instance, a 100x100-pixel image 
   that is printed in a 1-inch square could be said to have 100 pixels per inch, regardless of the printer's DPI capability. Used in this
 way, the measurement is only meaningful when printing an image. 
     Good quality photographs usually require 300 pixels per inch when printed.

 Q. What is an Image ?
    :- When we combine mutiple pixels with each other and collection of all these pixels is consider as image. 
       In python image is store in an 2d array. And array exists in Numpy.
